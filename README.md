# PyLadies Lithuania - Sample Streamlit app

This is a skeleton Streamlit app for the PyLadies workshop at PyConLT 2025. See below for how to get started running the app.

There is an initial dataset in the `data` folder.

You will get instructions on how to complete the app in the workshop - you will primarily be updating the code in `app.py`.

To see an example version of a built out app: https://github.com/nmenezes0/pyladies-full-app.


## Getting started

First fork the repo:

Then you can either:

* Run in GitHub Codespaces (note there are limits to how much you can use - see [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-your-products/managing-billing-for-github-codespaces/about-billing-for-github-codespaces))
* Run locally on your laptop


### Running in GitHub Codespaces

Go to: [http://github.com/codespaces](http://github.com/codespaces).

Then create a new codespace based on your forked version of the repo (the repo name will be something like `<your-username>/pyladies-streamlit-app`/.

Once your codespace has got started, run the app by typing `streamlit run app.py` in the terminal.


### Running locally
* Clone the forked repository.
* Install packages (ideally into a virtual environment): `pip install -r requirements.lock`.
* Run the app: `streamlit run app.py`.
